It is the weekend after midterms and you decide to go out with guys. Just a few hours after having started your night of fun you are no longer in your right mind, having gotten incredibly drunk. A beautiful young lady walks in and from that moment you want to get to know her. Hours later, you are no longer completely wasted, having sobered up a little while talking to the girl. The bar closes, and your friends leave but you are still with the girl. You help walk the girl, who is still very drunk, to her car. She is barely walking on her own so you manage to get her in the back seat. You begin to kiss and grope her, but because she is barely conscious she does not really react. Seizing the opportunity you start taking off her and your clothes, and you have sex with the girl. She did not say anything but she did squirm a little bit, and when it was time to go, you left her in the back seat of her car, with the car keys next to her and the doors locked. You thought that nothing bad would happen, because she was half-asleep the whole time. You thought she would not remember.
