<center><div class="box"><br><br>Welcome to Ultimate Justice. We, students of the 2016 Girls Who Code Summer Immersion program, proudly present to you the game designed to unveil the corruptness of the US Criminal Justice system. Currently, we have written four stories, all of which are based (to a certain extent) on real life scenarios, that display a different commentary on the justice system. In the game, you will have to make choices based on the situation you find yourself in, and the outcome of your story will be determined by those choices. Have fun, and check out the links posted at the end of each game. </div></center>
