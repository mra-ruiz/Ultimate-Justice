			<li>For the purpose for this game you are a black female. Your father died three days and go and you are driving home at night, crying hysterically. You are small compared to the police officer that pulls you over to give you a ticket for running a red light. He demands that you sign the ticket, but because you are so hysterical you are confused and do not sign. He demands that you get out of the car immediately yelling at you angrily. You lock the doos afraid of the violent police officer. He starts screaming at you 'stop f****** crying!' He drags you out of the open car window and starts kicking you in the ribs. He handcuffs you, breaking your wrist in the process, and picked you up by the cuff links.</li>
